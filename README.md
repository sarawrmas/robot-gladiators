## Description
Robot Gladiators is a simple RPG created with JavaScript. To use, follow the prompts. First you will name your robot gladiator. Then the fun begins.

Your gladiator will fight 3 battles with 3 enemies, Roborto, Amy Android, and Robo Trumble. For each turn, you can choose to fight or skip.

If you fight, you cause damage to the enemy robot and their health will decrease. They will attack back and decrease your health with their damage. The round continues until one robot gladiator runs out of health.

If you skip, 10 coins will be deducted from your balance and you will move on to the next round.

If you win the round, you will earn coins that can be used at the store between rounds to refill your health by 20 points or upgrade your attack by 6 points. If you skip a battle, no coins will be rewarded and you will skip to the next round with your original health and attack power.

Can you reach the end and emerge victorious?
